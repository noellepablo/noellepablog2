Hello! My name is Noelle Pablo, and I am a data analyst at [Accessible Teaching, Learning, and Assessment Systems](https://atlas.ku.edu/) at the University of Kansas where I work on the [Dynamic Learning Maps alternate assessment](https://dynamiclearningmaps.org/) and the [Innovations in Science Map, Assessment & Report Technologies project](https://ismart.works/). I completed my B.S. in Statistics at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, and I am currently pursuing a M.S. in Applied Statistics, Analytics, and Data Science at the University of Kansas.
